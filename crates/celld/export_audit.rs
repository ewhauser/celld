//! Change export's audit side: the reconciler, `verify` and `erase`
//! (`docs/design/change-export.md`, "Completeness", "Snapshots and repair"
//! and "Erasure").
//!
//! All three compare the bucket with what a consumer holds, so they need the
//! consumer's read side. [`ConsumerView`] is that read side as a trait:
//!
//! - [`BucketConsumer`] is the reference consumer from `celld-export-format`
//!   fed with every record the bucket sink wrote under `export/changes/`. It
//!   is the consumer of a fleet that runs only the bucket sink, and the
//!   oracle the tests use.
//! - [`snowflake::SnowflakeConsumer`] is the loader's tables, the consumer
//!   of a blob-stream or Kafka fleet: it reads `CELL_STREAMS`,
//!   `CELL_CERTIFIED`, `CELL_SNAPSHOTS` and the records in `CELL_CHANGES`
//!   and `CELL_META`, writes findings and tombstones with the statements in
//!   [`snowflake`], and lands the audit's own records through Snowpipe
//!   Streaming. `--consumer snowflake` picks it (the `export-snowflake`
//!   feature); run the scheduled reconciler beside the loader.
//!
//! Nothing here writes to a cell's objects. The reconciler reads object
//! names, `verify` restores read-only through [`crate::export_restore`], and
//! what the audit writes goes under `export/` only: tombstones, reports, and
//! `gap` and `deleted` records in the bucket sink's own layout.
