//! The replication streams of Durable Object facets, shared by both engines.
//!
//! A facet is a database and a replication stream of its own, as a sibling
//! file is in workerd's own server. Its stream nests under the root's
//! coordinates (`engine_api::facet_cell`), is activated on first use with the
//! restore its root's activation used, and stops with the root. A facet has
//! no ownership record and no fence of its own; the root's cover it, since a
//! facet runs only inside its root.
//!
//! # Incarnations
//!
//! Change export names a facet's stream by the root, the facet's path, and
//! an **incarnation** the facet's `_cf_METADATA` keeps from its first open
//! (`docs/design/change-export.md`, "Facets"). A delete removes a facet and
//! every facet below it, including ones that are not resident and whose
//! incarnations this node never read, so incarnations are ordered rather
//! than random: every incarnation handed out before a delete is below the
//! delete's bound, and every one handed out after it is above. A `deleted`
//! record carries that bound, and a consumer removes exactly the streams at
//! or under the path whose incarnation is at or below it; a facet recreated
//! later, nested or not, survives.
//!
//! An incarnation is the root's epoch in the top [`INCARNATION_EPOCH_BITS`]
//! bits and a counter in the rest. Epochs grow with every activation, which
//! orders incarnations across nodes whatever their clocks. Within an epoch
//! the counter is bounded by a durable mark beside the root's epoch
//! database, so a root that registers again at the same epoch (a clean
//! reload, or a restart in place) counts on from above everything it
//! handed out before, whatever the clock did. The counter starts from the
//! wall clock only for an epoch with no mark.
