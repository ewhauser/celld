//! Change-export capture on a cell's connection (docs/design/change-export.md,
//! "Capture").
//!
//! One SQLite session per open cell records the net row changes of its
//! exported tables. At a safe point the changeset is pulled, the session is
//! recreated, and the changes are materialized into whole-row
//! [`TableRows`] in the export record format. A commit that is too large to
//! track, or that cannot be materialized, becomes `bulk` for the tables it may
//! have touched instead.
//!
//! rusqlite's `Session` borrows the connection and hides its handle, so it can
//! neither live beside the connection in `OpenCell` nor set
//! `SQLITE_SESSION_OBJCONFIG_ROWID`. [`Capture`] drives the C API directly.
//!
//! A WAL hook on the same connection stamps each commit with where its last
//! frame landed ([`WalStamp`]), which release matches against the LTX files
//! the capture loop reports. Installing the hook replaces SQLite's default
//! autocheckpoint, so the hook runs the same passive checkpoint itself.
//!
//! Schema changes are found by comparing `sqlite_schema` with what the cell
//! last exported, at the same safe point, not through the authorizer (plan
//! C9): `deleteAll` drops tables with the authorizer off, and the authorizer
//! reports neither the kind of an `ALTER TABLE` nor a rename's new name. Each
//! exported table has a generation that starts at one and moves on every
//! change to its definition, and a drop and recreate under one name is a new
//! generation. Generations persist in the cell's own [`GENERATIONS_TABLE`],
//! written right after the change is seen, so they move and restore with the
//! cell (plan C10). A table whose generation opened in a commit is exported
//! as an inline snapshot rather than rows, or as `bulk` when it is larger than
//! `CELLD_EXPORT_MAX_TX_BYTES`. See "DDL and table generations" in the design.
//!
//! The key-value tables are reshaped on the way out ([`kv`]): `_cf_KV` is
//! exported as `kv`, and `__kv` gains its blob references. Their rows,
//! snapshots, `bulk` entries and `schema` records all use the exported shape.
