// Export sinks are shell tasks outside the execution boundary, like telemetry.
#![allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]

//! Change-export sinks (`docs/design/change-export.md#sinks`).
//!
//! [`ExportSink`] is what the exporter hands released records to. It takes
//! records for any set of streams and reports one terminal result per
//! record: acknowledged, or dropped with a reason. The exporter derives each
//! sink's delivered position from those results; a sink never tracks
//! positions itself.
//!
//! The contract every implementation keeps:
//!
//! - **Order.** Results arrive on the outcome channel in submission order,
//!   so a caller can advance a delivered position with a single cursor.
//! - **Acknowledged means durable.** A record is acknowledged only once the
//!   object or segment holding it has been written.
//! - **At least once.** A retried write can land twice; consumers drop
//!   duplicates by the dedup key.
//! - **Budgeted.** [`ExportSink::buffered_bytes`] counts every submitted
//!   record without a result yet, so the exporter can hold the sink buffer
//!   under the shared queue budget.
//!
//! [`BucketSink`] is the first implementation: Parquet objects in the bucket
//! through [`parquet_batch`], one row per record.
