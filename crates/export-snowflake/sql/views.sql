-- Change export: what the consumer derives from CELL_CHANGES and CELL_META.
--
-- These views are the design's precedence rules in SQL, and the test suite
-- checks them against the reference consumer in crates/export-format. Each
-- one names the part of `consumer.rs` it follows. They read the tables
-- directly, so they are always current; the loader may materialize the
-- expensive ones.

-- "Stream" below means the five columns SCRIPT, CLASS, CELL, FACET and
-- INCARNATION. A CUT_RANK is POSITION_KEY, ':', the origin's rank (live 0,
-- snapshot 1, repair 2) and ':', then the snapshot id: comparing two as
-- strings compares (position, origin, snapshot id), the order in which one
-- snapshot beats another.

-- statement: cell_streams
-- Every stream seen, with the position a `deleted` record naming the stream
-- removed it at, and whether it is gone entirely: named by a facet `deleted`
-- record on its root's stream, or erased. `facet_deletions` in consumer.rs.
